# MTGAssistant

This is my Honours Project at Carleton University for the Winter 2017 semester. The application is general deck building tool that is meant to be used for creating decks for "Magic The Gathering". Through this tool, users are able to browse the local card database, select cards matching their criteria, and then add them to decks that they have created. Once a deck's contents have been fully collected, and the user is ready, they are able to submit it to the local database for persistant storage.

If you are interested in the features that the project has, they are as follows:
1. Local card database browsing (basic and advanced functionality supported)
2. Local deck persistance storage (creation, modification, and deletion)
3. Connection to a MTGAssistant server (which provides the following benefits)
..* Viewing of any deck decks stored on the server
..* Editing of any deck decks stored on the server
..* Ability to delete any deck on the server
